About
=====

Easily integrate `Open Forms`_ in your Wordpress website. There are 2 main 
features:

#. Configuration to connect to Open Forms is added to your Wordpress settings.
#. Add Open Forms as a Wordpress block plugin on any page, you get a list of 
   forms in Open Forms to choose from.

If you have `Sentry`_ available, you can configure Sentry as well so Open Forms
can report errors to it.
